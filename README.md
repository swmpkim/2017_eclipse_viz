# 2017 Eclipse Visualizations

This repo contains the code that produced the joyplot of PAR data at NERR stations across the country, featured in a guest blog post on GTM's blog, [NERRDs on the water](http://www.nerrdsonthewater.com).  

The "Eclipse_visualization.Rmd" file is the main one; the files of the same name that end in ".md" and ".html" are output.
